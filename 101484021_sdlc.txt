Learning DevOps is crucial in the software development cycle as it bridges the gap between
development and operations, fostering collaboration and efficiency. By integrating continuous
integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD), and automation, DevOps accelerates deployment,
reduces errors, and ensures faster delivery of high-quality software. It also enhances scalability,
reliability, and security, enabling teams to respond swiftly to market demands and customer feedback.
Embracing DevOps practices ultimately leads to improved productivity, innovation, and a competitive
edge in the software industry.
